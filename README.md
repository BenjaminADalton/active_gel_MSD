# active_gel_MSD
3D simulation of an active gel with tools to calculate filament MSDs over many time scales.

18-03-2021 - Benjamin Dalton - dalton@zedat.fu-berlin.de

Simulate active filament gel with rigid filaments and kinesis like motors.

Pseudo 3D system with periodic boundary conditions in x,y and with solid walls in z.

Motors follow a 2-state binding rule (see Dalton et. al. 2021 Supplemental material for more information).

MSD Tools are included to calculate the MSD of filaments over three time scales with multi-time step data recording, which can be combined to generate a single MSD over many decades of time.
